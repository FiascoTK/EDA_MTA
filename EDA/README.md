The goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis to search for stations with high traffic before Yankee Home games to help maximize the sales of Yankee hat hawkers.  I worked with turnstile data provided by the MTA (Links to an external site) and Yankee schedule information found on MLB.com (Links to an external site).These datasets allowed me to leverage turnstile traffic information and Date/Time information to find the highest traffic subway station during the window of expected to travel to Yankee home games.  161st-Yankee Stadium Station exhibited the most consistent high exit traffic increase during game days compared to regular weekdays.  The traffic increase was at its most pronounced on Fridays.
